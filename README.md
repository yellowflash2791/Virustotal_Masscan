# Virustotal_Masscan
Virustotal is a great source to find the reputation of suspicious files.We generally upload a single file and check for its status,Assume if we have a Directory having many subdirectories and files,it would be difficult to upload files one by one and check for its reputation.Hence to overcome this issue i have writtern a small python script that will give the reputation of all the files in a directory.
