# Virustotal_Masscan
Virustotal is a great source to find the reputation of suspicious files.We generally upload a single file and check for its reputation,Assume if we have a Directory having many subdirectories and files,it would be difficult to upload files one by one and check for its reputation.Hence to overcome this issue i have writtern a small python script that will give the reputation of all the files in a directory.

Installation 

run the bash script virustotal_masscan.sh

Execution

./virustotal_masscan.py
What do you want to upload on VirusTotal
0: Scan the directory and subdirectories in it for malicious files
1: Scan a file or hash
Enter the option: 0
